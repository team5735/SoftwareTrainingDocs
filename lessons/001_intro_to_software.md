# INTRO TO SOFTWARE
[//]: # "This is less so a lesson and more of a presentation. The hope is to give this one in one of the first meetings, to give an overview of software. This presentation should take approx. 15-30 minutes."
## Opening

When thinking of a robot, the physical form is often what comes to mind, yet for any practical projects, a union of two equally complex fields must be made:

1. mechanics, the tangible body of any project
2. software, the deep running nervous system of a robot

Software is responsible for moving data to and from different core parts within the robot, making complex analysis from the data, and controlling all outward functions of the robot with such analysis.

We hope that, by the end of this presentation:
- we will properly convey the basics of robot code and why it matters
- all members of the Control Freaks will understand the Software subteam and its workflows
- we will garner interest in members potentially joining the Software subteam
